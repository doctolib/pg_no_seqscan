# Contributing

Here are some hints to prepare your environment to contribute to the project:

- Install git (pre-commit)[https://pre-commit.com/] hooks with `pre-commit install`
- Switch to cargo fmt nightly to support the `Ignore` configuration:

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
```

- Start a PG with the extension `cargo pgrx run`
- Run tests with `cargo pgrx regress` (use options --resetdb to force the reset of the db, and --auto to automatically update the expected results)
- Format with `cargo fmt`
- Lint with `cargo clippy`

Pg_no_seqscan must be initialized in the extension's _PG_init() function, and can only be started if loaded through the
shared_preload_libraries configuration setting.

In order that all future workers answering queries use this extension, you'll need to edit the proper postgresql.conf file
in "${PGRX_HOME}/data-$PGVER/postgresql.conf" and add this at the end of the file:

    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_no_seqscan.so'
    jit_above_cost = 40000000000
    enable_seqscan = 'off'
    # Recommended to have logs with `tail -f ~/.pgrx/data-15/log/postgresql.log`
    logging_collector = on
    log_filename = 'postgresql.log'
