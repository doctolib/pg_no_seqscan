# Contributing

Here are some hints to prepare your environment to contribute to the project:

- Install git (pre-commit)[https://pre-commit.com/] hooks with `pre-commit install`
- Start a PG with the extension `cargo pgrx run`
- Run tests with `cargo test`
- Format with `cargo fmt`
- Lint with `cargo clippy`

Pg_no_seqscan must be initialized in the extension's _PG_init() function, and can only be started if loaded through the
shared_preload_libraries configuration setting.

In order to use this bgworker with pgrx, you'll need to edit the proper postgresql.conf file
in "${PGRX_HOME}/data-$PGVER/postgresql.conf" and add this line to the end:

    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_no_seqscan.so'
    jit_above_cost = 40000000000
    enable_seqscan = 'off'
    # This could help to have logs with `tail -f ~/.pgrx/data-15/log/postgresql.log`
    logging_collector = on
    log_filename = 'postgresql.log'
